"Asteroids" is a simple Python game similar to the classic arcade game Asteroids by Atari. This was one of the culminating projects required of students in my Object-Oriented Programming/Data Structures class (CS241). The skeletal format of the code was provided and was subsequently filled in and completed based on what I wanted the game to do. This assignment was designed to test skills in object-oriented programming in Python and other sub-topics such as inheritance and polymorphism.
