This folder contains code pertaining to the Decision Tree project in CS450 -  Machine Learning. The classifier runs through the ID3 algorithm and builds a tree using the training data. The model uses the tree to classify the testing data.

Files with the 'scratch' extension are scratch files, just messy workspaces but the code may be useful later.
